/**
 * Given a string s and an array of strings words, return then number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.
 * 
 * Example 1
 * Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * Example 2
 * Input s = "dsahjpjauf", words= ["ahjpjau", "ja", "ahvwzgqnuk", "tnmlanowax"]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 1 approach
 * We can get all possible subsequence of s and store them in a map then compare all word in words to it
 * 
 * Brute force
 * Loop through words and then check if it is a subsequence of s then increase count if it is
